        const recommendations = [
            {
                title: "Adopt a unified, risk-informed Umbrella ToC",
                priority: "High",
                rationale: "One Umbrella Theory of Change (ToC) gives the country programme a single, shared map for joint strategic monitoring and decision-making, replacing siloed thematic views with a common results frame that everyone co-owns. It aligns Annual Work Plans (AWPs) and budgets to the same outcomes and risks, enables timely cross-team course-correction, and anchors performance dialogues with government and partners. In periods of anticipated change (policy, climate, financing), the shared ToC also drives structured adaptive management. Crucially, it sharpens UNFPA’s advantage in systems change and impact orientation.",
                implications: [
                    "Design the Umbrella ToC: run a 4–6 week co-design sprint that maps HDP phases, megatrends, system functions, indicators, and assumptions/risks.",
                    "Transition roll-in plan: Q2 map all outputs/AWPs/budget lines to the ToC; Q3–Q4 full alignment.",
                    "One governance & review table: appoint a ToC Steward; hold monthly joint reviews (Programme+Ops+M&E+Humanitarian).",
                    "Minimal joint dashboard: 10–12 core indicators with district “system floors” tracked quarterly.",
                    "Risk-to-budget mechanics: pre-set contingency/pre-positioning lines and bridge financing.",
                    "Update all Implementing Partner (IP) MoUs/ToRs to the Umbrella ToC, with a 1-pager on assumptions/risks and equity results."
                ]
            },
            {
                title: "Standardize and scale-up proven models",
                priority: "High",
                rationale: "Scaling is durable when excellence is standardized, budgetized, and codified so ministries can adopt beyond pilot sites. Linking Population Dynamics (PD) evidence to budget classifications turns analysis into allocation and sharpens equity. South-South & Triangular Cooperation (SSTC) provides the diffusion engine (peer learning, cost benchmarking, pooled procurement), while systematization of good practices and lessons converts tacit knowledge into concise, reusable packages, accelerating policy uptake, quality, and replication.",
                implications: [
                    "Define the standard package: one specification per model (norms/QA, indicators, referral closure).",
                    "Map to money (Q2): confirm budget codes/AWP lines for each package.",
                    "Quality & fidelity: Implement a QA toolkit with a simple fidelity score.",
                    "Communication & transfer: Create a replication kit (policy brief, cost note, SOPs, explainer) and pursue policy circular/gazette and SSTC twinning.",
                    "Systematization loop: Quarterly harvest of good practices/lessons to update SOPs and replication kits.",
                    "Adoption tracking: Use a quarterly dashboard on adoption–quality–equity.",
                    "Require IP use of the national QA toolkit and submission of a fidelity score."
                ]
            },
            {
                title: "Make equity visibility & performance non-negotiable (Effective LNOB)",
                priority: "High",
                rationale: "Transformational change needs more than disaggregation; it needs goals you manage to. A country-owned Leave No One Behind (LNOB) indicator set makes distributional effects visible, sets clear targets (e.g., parity/need-adjusted coverage, ≥85–90% closed-loop referrals, accessibility compliance floors), and hard-wires course-correction into monthly/quarterly management. Using the Washington Group approach for disability and standard fields ensures comparability and protects privacy.",
                implications: [
                    "Define LNOB indicator pack (Q1): 5–7 tracers (data completeness, coverage, referral closure, accessibility, equity-tagged spend).",
                    "Set targets & floors (Q2): establish national + district targets and minimum floors in AWPs and partner MoUs/ToRs.",
                    "ToC-linked monitoring loop: map each LNOB tracer to the Umbrella ToC for quarterly review and corrective actions.",
                    "Data quality & safeguards: provide brief training/supervision on WG-SS fields and ensure privacy/safety protocols.",
                    "Finance link: tie equity floors to disbursement calendars and protect LNOB lines during budget re-phasing.",
                    "Insert LNOB targets/floors in IP MoUs."
                ]
            },
            {
                title: "Fix execution bottlenecks for continuity and efficiency",
                priority: "High",
                rationale: "Stop–start delivery inflates costs (emergency buys, idle resources), weakens quality, and disproportionately harms LNOB outreach. Predictable disbursement and procurement lead times, reliable stocks, and clean warehouse-to-facility handoffs are core determinants of results and Value for Money (VfM)—they convert planned outputs into real, equitable coverage and make spending more efficient.",
                implications: [
                    "One delivery calendar: lock monthly cash-release and procurement schedules to the AWP.",
                    "Lead-time & stock floors: establish procurement SLAs (e.g., ≤45 days competitive) and ≥95% stock reliability for tracer commodities.",
                    "Last-mile basics: implement standard issue/receipt tracking and referral transport slots.",
                    "Forecasting & S&OP: align activity calendars, cash-flow, and stock forecasts; cap Q4 spend share (e.g., ≤30%).",
                    "ToC-linked ops dashboard: track on-time disbursement, cycle time, stockouts, and LNOB execution rates quarterly."
                ]
            },
            {
                title: "Shift from funding to financing with a VfM/ROI compact",
                priority: "High",
                rationale: "Durable results require appropriations, not ad-hoc grants. Financing that is coded in the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and executed through routine budgets stabilizes service continuity and protects LNOB lines. A clear compact with finance authorities (MoF/ERD) translates evidence and standards into fiscal commitments, strengthens credibility with IFIs/private partners, and aligns humanitarian preparedness with sustainable resources.",
                implications: [
                    "Funding to finance compact (Q1): agree on a roadmap with MoF/ERD.",
                    "Cost & code (Q2): cost policy wins and assign MTEF/budget codes/AWP lines (incl. resilience & LNOB).",
                    "Efficiency levers: expand pooled procurement/framework agreements; introduce a lite VfM/ROI pack in AWP reviews.",
                    "Equity finance: set equity floors and benefit-incidence targets for adolescents and PWD, and track execution.",
                    "Bridge the transition: pre-arrange bridge financing/disbursement calendars to avoid Q4 compression."
                ]
            },
            {
                title: "Move from innovations to strategic innovation",
                priority: "Medium-High",
                rationale: "Strategic innovation focuses scarce resources on problems that matter for the Umbrella ToC, producing decision-grade evidence for norms, indicators, and budgets. It shifts the mindset from scattered piloting to structured validation and scale, strengthening the normative role, investability, and portability via SSTC. This realizes the Strategic Plan’s innovation and transformation agenda by moving proofs to standards, budgets, and cross-country replication.",
                implications: [
                    "Stand up the protocol (Q1): approve stage-gates; form a small Strategic Innovation Review Board.",
                    "Equity & safety gates: require PWD accessibility, adolescent-friendly features, and safeguards before scaling.",
                    "Registry & briefs: create a 1-page evidence/cost note with VfM & equity readout per model.",
                    "Budget & procurement enablement: assign budget codes, add to catalogues, and use pooled procurement for roll-out.",
                    "ToC-linked scale dashboard: track adoption rate, time-to-scale, and equity outcomes quarterly; prep SSTC replication kits.",
                    "Run IP pilots as time-boxed innovation labs with clear pass-to-scale criteria."
