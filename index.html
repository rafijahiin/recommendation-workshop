                title: "ToC to articulate a stronger systems",
                priority: "High",
                recommendationText: "Adopt a unified, risk-informed Umbrella ToC that integrates the HDP nexus and system-strengthening. It makes megatrends and risk-to-budget choices explicit, clarifies shared outcomes and cross-thematic dependencies (HRH, supply chains, QA/supervision, referrals), and positions population data to steer policy and finance built to technical quality (clear assumptions, indicators, learning loops) as a live strategic-management tool.",
                rationale: "One Umbrella ToC gives the country programme a single, shared map for joint strategic monitoring and decision-making, replacing siloed thematic views with a common results frame that everyone co-owns. It aligns AWPs and budgets to the same outcomes and risks, enables timely cross-team course-correction, and anchors performance dialogues with government and partners. In periods of anticipated change (policy, climate, financing), the shared ToC also drives structured adaptive management—with pre-agreed triggers, scenario options, and a routine ToC review cadence—so the office’s proven agility becomes systematic practice. Crucially, it sharpens UNFPA’s advantage in systems change and impact orientation by focusing on core system functions (HRH, supply chains, QA/supervision, referrals) and by mapping causal links from norms and data use to service performance, and to outcomes/impact, enabling contribution analysis and PD-to-budget shifts that sustain equitable results at scale.",
                conclusions: "1, 3, 6",
                implications: [
                    "Design the Umbrella ToC: run a 4–6 week co-design sprint that maps HDP phases, megatrends, system functions, indicators, and assumptions/risks.",
                    "Transition roll-in plan: Q2 map all outputs/AWPs/budget lines to the ToC; Q3–Q4 full alignment—temporarily gate new pilots until they’re ToC-mapped.",
                    "One governance & review table: appoint a ToC Steward; hold monthly joint reviews (Programme+Ops+M&E+Humanitarian) with version control of ToC changes.",
                    "Minimal joint dashboard: 10–12 core indicators (HRH, supply reliability, QA/supervision, referral closure, equity disaggregation, crisis readiness) with district “system floors” tracked quarterly.",
                    "Risk-to-budget mechanics: pre-set contingency/pre-positioning lines, scenario playbooks, and bridge financing to protect resilience and equity lines during the transition year.",

                priority: "High",
                recommendationText: "Standardize → budgetize proven SRHR/GBV/A&Y models and data. Turn validated models and standards (midwifery protocols, GBV clinical pathways, referral closure, DHIS2/PD products) into the national routine by codifying them in norms/QA tools and assigning budget codes and packaging them for policy uptake (gazette/indicator compendium) and cross-country replication via South-South & Triangular Cooperation (SSTC).",
                rationale: "Scaling is durable when excellence is standardized, budgetized, and codified so ministries can adopt beyond pilot sites. Linking PD evidence to budget classifications turns analysis into allocation and sharpens equity (including adolescents and PwD). SSTC provides the diffusion engine (peer learning, cost benchmarking, pooled procurement), while systematization of good practices and lessons converts tacit knowledge into concise, reusable packages, accelerating policy uptake, quality, and replication.",
                conclusions: "3, 5, 10, 11, 12, 13",
                implications: [
                    "Define the standard package: one spec per model (norms/QA, indicators, referral closure).",

                priority: "High",
                recommendationText: "Make equity visibility & performance non-negotiable. Complete disability and marginalized fields across DHIS2/MPDSR/GBV information systems and adopt a lean LNOB indicator pack with explicit targets—% of adolescents, PWD, and marginalized reached (need-adjusted), referral-closure rates, facility accessibility compliance, data-completeness, and equity-tagged spend—reported in simple district dashboards with minimum floors and regular reviews.",
                rationale: "Transformational change needs more than disaggregation; it needs goals you manage to. A country-owned LNOB indicator set makes distributional effects visible, sets clear targets (e.g., parity/need-adjusted coverage, ≥85–90% closed-loop referrals, ≥95% data completeness, accessibility compliance floors, protected equity budgets), and hard-wires course-correction into monthly/quarterly management. Using the Washington Group approach for disability and standard fields ensures comparability, protects privacy, and aligns equity management across the HDP continuum from crisis to routine systems.",
                conclusions: "3, 6, 12, 13",
                implications: [
                    "Define LNOB indicator pack (Q1): 5–7 tracers (data completeness, need-adjusted coverage/parity index, referral closure, accessibility compliance, equity-tagged spend/execution).",
                    "Set targets & floors (Q2): national + district targets and minimum floors in AWPs and partner MoUs/ToRs.",

                recommendationText: "Fix execution bottlenecks to protect timeliness, equity, and value for money. Align cash release, approvals/ERP, procurement, and last-mile logistics to one delivery calendar so services flow steadily (not Q4-compressed), unit costs fall, and LNOB lines for adolescents, persons with disabilities (PWD), and are not crowded out.",
                rationale: "Stop–start delivery inflates costs (emergency buys, idle resources), weakens quality, and disproportionately harms LNOB outreach. Predictable disbursement and procurement lead times, reliable stocks, and clean warehouse-to-facility handoffs are core determinants of results and VfM—they convert planned outputs into real, equitable coverage and make spend more efficient.",
                conclusions: "3, 4, 5",
                implications: [
                    "One delivery calendar: lock monthly cash-release and procurement schedules to the AWP; publish Q1–Q4 milestones.",

                priority: "High",
                recommendationText: "Shift from funding to financing with a VfM/ROI compact. Move from short-cycle, projectized funding to domestically anchored, multi-year financing that carries proven SRHR/GBV/A&Y/PD models and resilience lines across the HDP continuum through fiscal cycles, by agreeing a compact with MoF/ERD, costing policy wins into MTEF/budget codes/AWPs, and tracking Value-for-Money/Return-on-Investment and benefit incidence for adolescents, persons with disabilities (PWD).",
                rationale: "Durable results require appropriations, not ad-hoc grants. Financing that is coded in MTEF and executed through routine budgets stabilizes service continuity, protects LNOB lines, and rewards efficiency via VfM/ROI evidence (unit costs, cost-per-outcome, equity incidence). A clear compact with finance authorities (MoF/ERD) translates evidence and standards into fiscal commitments, strengthens credibility with IFIs/private partners, and aligns humanitarian preparedness and system strengthening with sustainable resources.",

                priority: "Medium-high",
                recommendationText: "Make strategic innovation an office function with a clear scale pathway (incl. youth platforms). Treat innovation as mission-aligned, ToC-linked strategic innovation—not ad-hoc pilots—guided by one Innovation-to-Scale Protocol (proof-of-concept → standard/indicator → budget line/OPS), a light innovation registry, and inclusion/safety gates (accessibility for PWD, adolescent-friendly design, safeguards, data privacy). Package validated models for policy uptake and SSTC replication.",
                rationale: "Strategic innovation focuses scarce resources on problems that matter for the Umbrella ToC, producing decision-grade evidence for norms, indicators, budgets, and operations. It also lets short, time-boxed projects run as “labs” with hypotheses, ethics/safety checks, equity & VfM metrics, and pass/fail criteria, so even brief grants yield validated models or fast stops. This shifts the mindset from scattered piloting to structured validation and scale, strengthening the normative role, investability, and portability via SSTC.",
